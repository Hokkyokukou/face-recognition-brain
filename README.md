### SmartBrain - Face Detection App üëÅÔ∏è‚ú®

> **Personal Description:**  
> _SmartBrain is a milestone project that brings together all the skills I acquired in my full-stack development journey. Through this app, I aimed to create a practical and interactive face detection solution, combining React for the front end, Node.js and Express.js for the back end, and PostgreSQL as the database. This project showcases a hands-on approach to programming with machine learning applications and serves as a potential foundation for implementing future features in AI and computer vision._

### Key Features üåü

- **Face Detection**: Using the Clarifai API, SmartBrain detects faces in uploaded images, providing an interactive and engaging user experience.
- **React Front-End**: The front end is built with React, creating a responsive and dynamic interface focused on simplicity and usability.
- **Node.js and Express Back-End**: This app uses a Node.js and Express server architecture to handle API logic efficiently.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: User data and interactions are stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data integrity and persistence.

### Project Objectives üèÜ
SmartBrain is designed as a showcase of practical full-stack skills. Specifically, this app demonstrates:
- _Basic knowledge of machine learning and external API integration for visual detection._
- _The ability to build a complete system, from front end to back end and database._
- _Experience in deploying applications on cloud platforms._
